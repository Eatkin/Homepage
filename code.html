        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>Here you can find various code snippets and projects I have worked on.</p>
        <p>I've worked on a range of different projects including front-end web development, games and web scrapers.</p>
        <p>You can also find any certificates for courses I've completed, along with lots and lots of solutions to
            programming problems I've worked on.</p>
        <p>Use the filters to find what you're searching for. I mostly work with Python and Gamemaker, but I like to
            try lots of different things, including esoteric programming languages such as Brainfuck.</p>
