                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Edward Atkin, mostly known as Ed.</p>
                <p>This website is my place to host the things I've made. I'm a programmer, game developer, and video
                    editor, amongst other things.</p>
                <p>On this website you can find a little bit of everything I've been working on, including my blog where
                    I talk about nothing inparticular and my hellish webcomic.</p>
                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <h3>Games</h3>
                <p>I first started working with Gamemaker when I was around 11 years old. My friends and I always talked
                    about these cool games we wanted to make, inspired by PS1 platformers like Spyro the Dragon and
                    Crash Bandicoot.</p>
                <p>One day I sat down and actually tried to make games. It didn't really go that well because it turns
                    out game development is hard and there weren't a huge amount of tools available back in 2003.</p>
                <p>I've been working on games again since about 2018 and have amassed quite a collection in a variety of
                    genres, styles and qualities.</p>
                <p>Game development has slowed down a lot as other things have taken priority, but you can visit my <a
                        href="games.html" target="_self">games</a> page for an archive of what I've made.</p>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Even though I have vast experience programming with Gamemaker, making the switch to any other
                    programming language always
                    proved to be a formidable task.</p>
                <p>As of 2023, I been having much more success with learning to code, and I have come to favour Python
                    as my programming language of choice.</p>
                <p>In April 2023 I began learning Data Science through <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/"
                        target="_blank">Le Wagon's</a> part time Data Science Bootcamp.</p>
                <p>You can view various projects I've worked on in my <a href="code.html" target="_self">code</a> page.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Things</h3>
                <p>Here's some other things I like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing Lego video games</li>
                    <li>Inline skating</li>
                    <li>Surfskating</li>
                    <li>Playing guitar</li>
                    <li>Foraging</li>
                    <li>Cats</li>
                    <li>Growing vegetables</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I recommend having a look at my <a href="blog.html" target="_self">blog</a> for more things about my
                    life including pointless life stories and other rambling annecdotes. There are some pictures to look
                    at.</p>
