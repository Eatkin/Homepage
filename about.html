                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Edward Atkin, mostly known as Ed.</p>
                <p>This website is my place to host the things I've made. I'm a programmer, game developer, and video
                    editor. I occasionally do some writing and compose some music.</p>
                <p>On this website you can find a little bit of everything I've been working on.</p>
                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>I first started working with Gamemaker when I was around 11 years old. My friends and I always talked
                    about these cool games we wanted to make, inspired by PS1 platformers like Spyro the Dragon and
                    Crash Bandicoot.</p>
                <p>One day I sat down and actually tried to make games. It didn't really go that well because it turns
                    out game development is hard and there weren't a huge amount of tools available back in 2003.</p>
                <p>I've been working on games again since about 2018 and have amassed quite a collection in a variety of
                    genres, styles and qualities.</p>
                <p>Other things I like include: playing Lego video games, inline skating, trying to play the guitar,
                    foraging, growing vegetables and cats.</p>
