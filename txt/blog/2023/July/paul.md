It is with a heavy heart I have to accept that my grandad has died. This is the first death of somebody close to me I have experienced and I don't really know how to process it, so perhaps writing a little about him will help.

It wasn't entirely unexpected. He was 91, had multiple health conditions and seemed to near constantly have infections. However, as of late, his mental faculties seemed to have improved and he generally looked a lot healthier.

Towards the end, he was very immobile and stuck in a chair most of the day, so I got him some audiobooks. I feel like he was getting some more joy out of his life that way.

In the end, an unexpected health complication struck him down. Myself and my family got to spend some time with him during his final moments.

He didn't finish listening to his audiobook from the library, The Great North Road, so I told him what happened.


## Thoughts


It is actually difficult to organise my thoughts about this, since I have known this man literally my entire life, and yet, because I was his grandson, he seemed to want to talk much more about me than himself. I feel like I only know little snippets of his life story. So in light of that, I will just write essentially random snippets that I think of.

He was an evacuee during world war 2, and following that he left school at the tender age of 14 and began work as a plant operator.

Once he told me that after working with greasy, oily materials all day, one of the best things was being able to remove it all in a bath of wood shavings.

Everybody around him smoked cigarettes, and yet he never did, but he still suffered the effects of it due to being in a smokey confined space.

Him and my grandma met when they were 16 and 17, meaning they spent a massive 75 years together. They decided to get married after a few years in order to move into a house together.

## My Early Life

I was looked after by my grandparents a lot whilst younger. Among vague memories I remember my granddad having a set of wooden building blocks around their house, which I enjoyed constructing things with. He also had a variety of rolls of tape, which for some reason I considered to be an excellent play thing. I would roll rolls of tape across the floor to keep myself entertained.

I was a very anxious child and scared of lots of things, so even though at times I fully intended to stay with my grandparents for the night, the time would come to sleep in an unfamiliar bed and I would have to be taken home late at night to be returned to the safety of my home.

## Collecting

My granddad was very into antiques, and also very skilled at repairs. He used to purchase and repair writing boxes that had seen better days.

Once he unveiled a series of Penny Black stamps in the secret drawer of one, which clearly its prior owner was not aware of.

I remember once coming across a sword with a broken handle in his garage, thinking he was mad for buying a sword, but he dutifully repaired it because whomever was selling it was unable to.

Obviously at some point these tasks became too much for him, and he accumulated many stacks of writing boxes which remained un-repaired.

He also loved ships in bottles. Seriously he had so many, it's utter madness how many he had. He constantly put up new shelves to house his collection of ships in bottles. I asked if he ever made his own, and he said yes but not many and they weren't very good.

He was, infact, extraordinarily talented at many things. He maintained everything in his house until he was no longer able to. We used to take pieces of scrap wood he had laying around and construct primitive wooden models such as aeroplanes or a ships.

I enjoyed reading Beano and Dandy comics when I was young, and he dutifully kept a list of every annual I had. He managed to source me a complete set of annuals from 1968 up until about 2008, when I started to lose interest in children's comics. I read the absolute life out of those annuals though.

You might say he was quite a collector. He has a huge book collection, covering every imaginable subject, and an expansive stamp collection which I don't know enough about to appreciate.

## Closing

I find it saddest of all that he remained positive about life until the end. No matter what he went through, what ailments afflicted him and how immobile he became, he just shifted the goal posts and adapted to it.

To take such a sudden decline, overnight, is heartbreaking.

He passed surrounded by his closest family members.

Rest in peace, Paul Rudly Callard.
