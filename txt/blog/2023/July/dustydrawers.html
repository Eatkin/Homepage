<h1>On the Dusty Drawers Full of Abandoned Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Raspberry Pis</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pis are pretty cool aren't they? An all in one computer with a GPIO header to allow easy integration with circuitry. A great way to learn programming and electronics all in one.</p>
<p>One year I decided as a birthday treat i would order myself a Raspberry Pi 400, with good intentions to learn new things. I got some circuitry to play with and then set out doing some basic programming.</p>
<p>But now, years on, my collection of various raspberry pis and electronics components all lie dormant in a drawer gathering dust.</p>
<p>My poor Raspberry Pi Sense HAT, taken out the box to look at how cool it was, then never used.</p>
<p>My camera modules, one of which was used once, the other lying dormant.</p>
<p>The RGBW LED strips, waiting for somebody to make a cool light sequence out of.</p>
<p>The servo kit, destined to be a pen plotter, only used a few times and for nothing resembling it's envisioned end point.</p>
<h2>Abandoned Hobbies</h2>
<p>This is a common theme amongst Raspberry Pi enthusiasts, we purchase boards and components and then just don't really have the drive or creativity to do anything with them.</p>
<p>Maybe I say I don't have time, but the fact of the matter is that I just don't really think of playing with my Pis when I do have time.</p>
<p>I never used them to learn programming, I never spent more than one day on my PICO-8 game, I never used DragonRuby Toolkit (probably the only game engine with a Raspberry Pi build), I never made my LED light show synchronised to Wizards in Winter, I never made my cat cam to see what my cats get up to in the day, I never made that pen plotter.</p>
<p>I am more than capable of doing these things I just...don't.</p>

<h2>The Fate of Adult Hobbies</h2>
<p>It's a lot easier to buy things with the intent of taking up a hobby than it is actually learning and practising the hobby itself.</p>
<p>Buying things is not a hobby.</p>
<p>Such is the fate of many adults trying to start something new.</p>
<p>My watercolour set I got for Christmas, only used for less than a week when I realised watercolour was hard and required a lot of dedication.</p>
<p>My stacks of plastic model kits, which I find enjoyable, albeit frustrating, but don't ever feel any drive to work on.</p>
<p>My animation books, scarcely explored.</p>
<p>And of course my Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>It's all just lying in some drawers uselessly, being ignored.</p>
<p>The crushing reality of feeling so enthusiastic at the point of purchase, only for that enthusiasm to fade away to nothing when the time comes to actually use my things.</p>
<h2>The Flipside</h2>
<p>This is quite a doomy blog, but let's take a look at the other side of things.</p>
<p>I always loved the idea of being able to rollerskate. I thought rollerskates were really cool and would make a novel mode of transport.</p>
<p>I ordered my first pair of inline skates (second hand, incase I abandoned it like so many other things) and set going.</p>
<p>It was horrible. Unlike many adults taking up inlines in their 30s, I had never learnt to skate as a kid. My first day i stood up and was completely cemented to the spot because i didnt know how to move.</p>
<p>But somehow I pushed past all that. I found the motivation to go out at 6am so nobody would see me, and learnt to skate properly.</p>
<p>It's nearly a year on and I love it. Although I found out they are an incredibly impractical mode of transport for various reasons</p>
<p>So I ordered a surfskate to get around instead, which again sat gathering dust for a while - I did have an excuse this time because I had a bad leg injury.</p>
<p>Eventually, after about 6 months, I managed to push myself to actually learn properly on my cheap, terrible Charger-X board. If you're going to get a surfskate, do yourself a favour and get a reputable brand - they're a lot easier to use and thus you will have a much more enjoyable time.</p>
<p>I now surfskate to get around and it's immensely enjoyable, albeit incredibly tiring and I have to carry around a heavy board with me. Impractical in a different way to roller skates.</p>
<h2>Going Outside</h2>
<p><img alt="An outdoor scene" src="/images/blog/2023/outside.png" /></p>
<p>You know what I think the difference is? Why I learnt to take up something like inline skating at 30 years old, when I'm usually so scared to do something new, when I have stacks of failed attempts at hobbies?</p>
<p>Because it involves going outside to do it. If I'm trying to learn to draw, or paint, or whatever, I'm at home. There are millions of distractions at home and I can instead take the path of least resistance - sit down on the sofa and waste time on the internet.</p>
<p>If I'm going to the park to learn to skate, that's all I'm doing. There is nothing else to do. If I want to give up, I have to go home again.</p>
<p>Maybe I should take those watercolours out with me.</p><p><a href="/blog.html">&#60;- Back to blog index</a></p>
