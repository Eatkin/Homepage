<h1>In Which I Break Free From My Sister's Banana Boycott</h1>
<p>I was the younger sibling in my household, thus, I had the tendancy to copy what my older sister did.</p>
<p>I used to eat bananas, until one day, she said she hated bananas. Well, I must hate bananas too!</p>
<p>I never ate a banana again.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<p><img alt="A really badly drawn, out of proportion banana" src="/images/blog/2023/banana.png" /></p>
<p>Actually more recently, I've been trying to get over my preconceptions of foods I don't "like". Despite never touching oranges, clementines or kiwis, I now regularly eat all of them.</p>
<p>But bananas, those were a psychological barrier that I found incredibly difficult to overcome. I've had them blended up into smoothies where you can't tell they're there, but an actual, whole banana? I couldn't do it.</p>
<p>One day, I just thought this is ridiculous. I've read enough psychology books to know that if I eat bananas, my brain will decide "Why would we eat bananas if we didn't like them?".</p>
<p>So I ate a damn banana, finally, and although my body resisted by making me feel nauseous, that banana was perfectly good.</p>
<p>Infact, now, I love bananas. I eat them all the time, they're the ideal fruit. So easy and convenient to eat. I even save the skins and cook and eat those as well.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, my sister has been merrily eating bananas this whole time because it turns out she was just being a petulant child.</p>
<p>This is about bananas, but it's also about overcoming preconceptions. There are so many things I don't do or put off because they're scary, or it's easier to just not do them.</p>
<p>So basically I didn't eat a banana for about 25 years because somebody else said they didn't like them.</p>
<p>Just eat the damn banana.</p><p><a href="/blog.html"><- Back to blog index</a></p>
