# On Bootcamp Disillusionment and Burnout

I took a major decision in my life this year, and decided to join a part time Data Science bootcamp to pivot my career in a completely new direction.

I am currently a brewer, but I have always had an interest in coding, I've just always really really struggled to learn alone.

This is likely one of the best decisions of my life, because as it turns out I really love doing data sciencey things and dealing with data, but after about 2 months of pushing hard I crashed just as hard.

This is some reflections on burnout and how I feel amidst it.

## The Decline

I was fully immersed in learning data science. I was doing supplementary reading, taking on my own personal projects, learning from courses on Udemy and Youtube, doing a completely insane amount of coding problems, making sure I fully understood every concept.

One day I sat down and thought "I don't want to do this anymore.". Suddenly doing any work just felt like the worst thing in the world

I feel like I haven't been able to recover from it. I struggle to focus on lectures, I struggle to focus on live code sessions, and where I used to talk and contribute, I now just stay silent and feel sad.

Where I would push out my comfort zone to ask questions and get support, I now just work alone.

## Breaking Free

I did have one project that partially snapped me out of my rut, and it was a completely unguided project where we had to work on a machine learning model to predict house prices. I spent the best part of 12 hours on it. So there is some spark still there, it's just that it's hiding away within me.

Unfortunately, whilst this has shifted the baseline up a little bit, I'm still feeling fried.

The worst thing is that when I think about these things, I feel sad. Like I've gone from doing incredibly at everything, to just being okay.

It's all too reminiscent of University where the first year went very well, then after that it all went down the drain and I was unable to ever recover from my poor mental state.

## Anti Rewards

I found great joy in solving coding problems on Codewars. I did a completely mad amount of problems, racking up about 600 solutions in 3 months. I almost found them addictive. I am now in the top 0.8% of users on the site for number of problems solved.

But since the crash, my brain's anti-reward system seems to find coding problems repellent. I can barely even focus enough to read the problem, let alone sit down and write code.

Not only that, but I feel like somehow by not doing these problems, my brain is losing the ability. Right now as I'm typing this, my knowledge of SQL queries I worked so hard to practise is surely being deleted from my head.

Now I would love this to be an inspirational story about how I managed to break free of these feelings and am now back to my old self, but I'm not. I don't know how to break out of this state of mind, but surely merely being in this state of mind is having a negative impact, causing a negative feedback loop, making everything worse, making me feel worse.

But perhaps, at the very least, you might be able to recognise some of these feelings.
