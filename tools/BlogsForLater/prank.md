# In Which I Prank My Mum and Then Feel Forever Guilty

You know when you're a teenager and you just fall out with your parents and whatever because you're a raging bag of hormones and don't know how to deal with your emotions?

Then you become an adult and realise you were just kind of a dickhead.

I don't even remember what I was annoyed about, but for some reason my mum annoyed me and my life was so unfair at the time, so I decided to pull a classic prank on her.

I went on her computer, took a screenshot of the desktop, set it as the wallpaper, hid the start menu and put all her desktop icons into a folder with no icon and the name being an invisible ASCII character (â€Ž ) if you need to use it (yes, whilst you cannot call a file or folder a single space, you can use this invisible ASCII character).

The result is that it looks like everything is perfectly normal, but there is no start menu and there are no icons to click on.

Now it's fair to say my mum isn't the best with technology, so what entailed was me watching her sat in silence, at her desk, trying to do things and not even realising anything was amiss. She must have just attributed the computer not doing what she wanted to her own ineptitude.

I felt immediately terrible experiencing this and basically just stood watching, rooted to the spot because I didn't want to admit I had done anything. I decided to take over and do what she needed to do for her. She even appreciated me "helping".

Now this was about 16 years ago and yet I still think about it, and I still get pangs of regret.

Be nice to your parents.

Sorry, mum.
